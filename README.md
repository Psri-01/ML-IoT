# Code description (summary)

1 • The code imports necessary libraries such as os, cv2, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, and tensorflow for image processing, data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning tasks.


2 • It defines the path to the directory containing the dataset and loads the labels from a CSV file.


3 • It determines the number of classes in the dataset by counting the subdirectories in the data path.


4 • It reads the resolution (height, width, and number of channels) of the first image in the dataset to understand the input dimensions.


5 • It sets up data generators using ImageDataGenerator to preprocess and augment the image data for training and validation.


6 • It constructs a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using Keras. The model consists of convolutional layers, max pooling layers, a global max pooling layer, dense layers, and dropout regularization.


7 • It compiles the model with the Adam optimizer, categorical cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.


8 • It trains the model on the training data using the fit function, specifying the number of epochs, batch size, and validation data.


9 • It evaluates the trained model on the validation data to obtain the test loss and accuracy.


10 • It converts the trained model to a TensorFlow Lite model using the tf.lite.TFLiteConverter and saves it as a .tflite file.


11 • Loading the model: The code starts by importing necessary libraries such as numpy, cv2 (OpenCV), and Interpreter from tflite_runtime. It then specifies the path to the saved TFLite model file (model_path) and creates an instance of the Interpreter class using the model path. The interpreter is allocated tensors to prepare for inference.


12 • Defining class labels: The code defines a list of class labels (class_labels) corresponding to the different categories the model can predict. The order of the labels should match the output of the model.


13 • Loading and preprocessing the input image: The code specifies the path to the input image (img_path) and reads it using OpenCV's cv2.imread function. The image is then resized to the input shape required by the model (64x64 pixels). The pixel values of the image are normalized to the range of [0, 1] by dividing by 255.0, converting the image to float32. Finally, a batch dimension is added to the image by expanding its dimensions using np.expand_dims.


14 • Running inference with the model: The code retrieves the input and output details of the model using the interpreter.get_input_details() and interpreter.get_output_details() methods. The input tensor is set to the preprocessed image using interpreter.set_tensor. The inference is performed by invoking the interpreter with interpreter.invoke(). The output tensor is obtained using interpreter.get_tensor.


15 • Predicting and printing the class label: The code uses np.argmax to find the index of the highest probability in the output tensor. This index is used to retrieve the corresponding class label from class_labels. Finally, the predicted class label is printed using print(predicted_label).
